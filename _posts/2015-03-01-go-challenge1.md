#### The world's first monthly Go Challenge for developers (newbies included) is now live!

<img align="right" src="http://rubylearning.com/images/m_aimonetti.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Matt Aimonetti" title="Matt Aimonetti" />
The first Go Challenge's author is [Matt Aimonetti](http://matt.aimonetti.net/) who is the CTO and co-founder of [Splice](https://splice.com/), a technology platform for music creators which streamlines the fragmented process of creating and sharing music, freeing musicians to spend their time and energy on the creative process. Long before Splice, Matt was a former sound engineer who tried his hand as an artist before transitioning to full time programming working for companies such as Sony PlayStation and LivingSocial. Matt has been active in the Open Source community for many years developing or contributing to many projects (Merb, Rails, MacRuby and many more), he also wrote a [free book about Go](http://www.golangbootcamp.com/) and is a published tech author for O'Reilly. Matt is based in Santa Monica, California.

Matt has this to say about the challenge:

> Very often developers just need an excuse to learn a new language or develop their own skills. The Go challenge is a great opportunity to work on a low-pressure, isolated, fun challenge and hopefully learn a lot. Getting out of the day to day programmer routine is an awesome way to challenge your brain and become a better developer.

#### The Go Challenge 1

This morning I took my daughter Giana to my secret lab to show her the various inventions I built over the years. That's when I realized that the awesome drum machine prototype I designed in the 90s had disappeared!!! The only related things I could find were printouts of the patterns I had created on the device as well as backups saved on floppy disks. Here are the printed patterns:

```
pattern_1.splice

Tempo: 120
(0) kick     |x---|x---|x---|x---|
(1) snare    |----|x---|----|x---|

I need your help to reverse engineer the binary format used by my drum machine and write a decoder so I will be able to implement a new drum machine, using Go this time!

You will find [attached 5 files](http://rubylearning.com/data/patterns.zip) with a pattern per file.

#### Some information about my legacy drum machine

My drum machine loads an audio sample per track allowing the programmer to schedule the playback of the sound. The scheduling of the playback is done using the concept of steps. A step is one of the parts of the measure that is being programmed (the programmed measure is known as a pattern). The measure (also called a bar) is divided in steps.

![measure.png](http://rubylearning.com/data/measure.png)

My drum machine only supports 16 step measure patterns played in 4/4 time. The measure is comprised of 4 quarter notes, each quarter notes comprised of 4 sixteenth notes and each sixteenth note corresponds to a step.
If all these music terms are confusing, don't worry, just know that the drum machine uses grid of 16 parts to let you trigger a sound. We have one sound per track and each track can be programmed independently. Each part is called a step. The speed of the playback is based on the tempo AKA bpm.

Taking an example from the printouts above:
```
(40) kick |x---|----|x---|----|
```

means that we have a track called "kick" (id 40) with the sound output being triggered on the first and ninth steps.

#### Goal

The goal of this challenge is to write a binary decoder that given a binary backup, outputs the same printouts as shown above.

#### Requirements

* Only use standard libraries

#### Hints

* Look around to see how data is usually serialized/encoded.
* Become familiar with encoding/binary package.
* ```hex.Dump()``` is very useful when debugging binary data.
* Think about the various permutations of data, imagine what other patterns could look like.
* Ensure that your code passes `go fmt/vet/lint`

#### I don't know where to start :(

The first step is to reverse engineer the binary file format. Look at the hex value to see if you can detect patterns. Binary data usually contains some sort of headers, then the encoded data. You should expect to find the data described in the printouts:

* version
* tempo
* track with each track containing
  * id
  * name
  * 16 steps

Then you need to write a decoder that takes one of the provided binary files and
extracts/prints the data.

#### Go further (optional, not evaluated for the challenge)

Add more cowbell, reading the binary format is one thing, being able to generate/modify the data is even more fun. Take a pattern of your choosing and add more cowbell!
